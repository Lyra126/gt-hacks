The secondary objectives will be to evaluate progression-free survival, survival at 1 year, and the safety of amrubicin as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma.",
          "detailedDescription": "Multiple small phase II trials exploring a variety of agents as second-line therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma have been performed. Overall, the most active of these agents have shown response rates of approximately 10-20% . Currently, there are no FDA approved agents for the second-line treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\nThe current study will explore the safety and activity of the novel anthracycline, amrubicin, as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.\n\nThe primary objective will be to evaluate the activity (as determined by objective response rate) of amrubicin as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate progression-free survival, survival at 1 year, and the safety of amrubicin as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\nSubjects will receive amrubicin IV daily x 3 days, every 21-days, with prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor. This 21-day time period is referred to as a cycle. Subjects will undergo repeat computed tomography (CT) scans after every 2 cycles. In the absence of progressive cancer, or prohibitive side effects, subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of treatment with amrubicin."

Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study."

The investigators propose that a drop in sCTX will correlate with improved pain, quality of life and a reduced incidence of further SREs.",
          "detailedDescription": "This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase IV study of pamidronate vs. zoledronic acid in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. Patients who are at high-risk of subsequent SREs will be screened for entry into this study. High-risk will be defined as fulfilling one or more of the following criteria: elevated sCTX (\\>400ng/L) and/or bone pain and/or a prior SRE and/or progression of bone disease (by imaging) despite at least 3 months of pamidronate therapy. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria, will be randomized to receive 3 cycles of intravenous zoledronic acid (4mg intravenously over 15 minutes) or to continue their standard dose of pamidronate. Both treatments will be given at 4 week intervals. Patients will be stratified according to whether or not they have had a SRE prior to study entry, progressive bone disease or bone pain. In order for the study to be double-blind, patients will receive two infusions simultaneously, at each study visit, one of the active drug and another of the placebo. After completing 3 cycles of study treatment, patients will resume their monthly intravenous pamidronate infusions as per current standard of care."

          "detailedDescription": "Trial Objectives:\n\n* To assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.\n* To observe the patterns of recurrence following the administration of the combination of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.\n* To assess the QOL, overall survival and disease free survival.\n\nTreatment\n\nSurgery: Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, +/- pelvic and aortic node sampling, omentectomy, peritoneal cytology.\n\nChemotherapy: Chemotherapy commences at the surgeon's and the medical oncologist's discretion and the time between surgery and start of chemotherapy will be recorded. One treatment cycle consists of 3 weeks.\n\nPaclitaxel and Carboplatin will be administered as follows:\n\nDay 1:\n\n* Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or po or phenergan 12.5 - 25 mg IV\n* Cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV\n* Dexamethasone 20 mg IV\n* Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2\n* Carboplatin AUC 6\n\nDay 22: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the second cycle.\n\nDay 43: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the third cycle.\n\nDay 64: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the fourth cycle.\n\nDay 85: After the fourth cycle of chemotherapy patients\n\nPatients with stage 4 disease will continue with chemotherapy for a total of 6 cycles.\n\nPatients with surgical stage 1b to 3c disease will receive whole pelvis external beam radiotherapy (50.4 Gy RD over 5 and a half weeks +/- paraaortic boost +/- vaginal vault brachytherapy boost). Radiotherapy will start 4 to 6 weeks after commencement of chemotherapy when the haematological count has recovered."
